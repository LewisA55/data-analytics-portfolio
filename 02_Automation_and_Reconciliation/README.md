# 🔁 Automation & Reconciliation  
### Financial Controls, Exception Handling & Invoice Validation

This section demonstrates a **generic, production-style reconciliation engine** designed to automate invoice validation, cost checking, and exception identification in a logistics / commercial finance context.

The focus is on **control design, repeatability, and auditability**, rather than any single carrier, client, or organisation.

All data used is **synthetic**, but the reconciliation logic mirrors real-world finance and operations workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Section

The objective of this section is to show how transactional data can be:

- Automatically reconciled against expected pricing logic  
- Validated through deterministic, repeatable rules  
- Flagged for exceptions requiring review  
- Summarised at invoice level for finance sign-off  

This reflects how reconciliation is handled in **scalable finance and operations teams**, not via manual spot checks.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

The reconciliation logic is designed around four core principles:

1. **Configuration over hard-coding**  
   Matching keys, tolerances, and column mappings are externalised.

2. **Explicit validation and controls**  
   Schema checks, join validation, and tolerance thresholds are enforced.

3. **Explainable exception handling**  
   Every variance is categorised into a clear status.

4. **Audit-friendly outputs**  
   Detailed line-level results and invoice-level summaries are produced.

This mirrors internal control design used in finance, audit, and assurance functions.

## ⚙️ Reconciliation Logic Overview

At a high level, the process performs the following steps:

- Standardises invoice and rate card inputs
- Validates required schema and join integrity
- Matches invoice lines to expected pricing rules
- Calculates expected cost using stepped rate logic
- Computes absolute and percentage variances
- Assigns deterministic status flags:
  - `MATCH`
  - `OVERCHARGED`
  - `UNDERCHARGED`
  - `NO_RATE_FOUND`
- Aggregates results to invoice-level summaries

Each step is transparent and traceable.

## 📊 Outputs Produced

The reconciliation process produces two primary outputs:

### **Reconciliation Detail**
Line-level results including:
- Expected vs billed amounts
- Absolute and percentage variance
- Pricing match status
- Rate availability flags

### **Reconciliation Summary**
Invoice-level rollups including:
- Consignment counts
- Total billed vs expected amounts
- Net variance
- Counts of overcharges, undercharges, and missing rates

These outputs are designed to support:
- Finance approval workflows
- Exception review
- Carrier or supplier discussions
- Downstream reporting

---

## 📦 Synthetic Data Approach

All inputs in this section use **synthetic, randomly generated data** that reflects realistic logistics invoice behaviour:

- Multiple invoices with multiple consignments
- Stepped pricing logic based on weight
- Noise introduced to simulate billing variance
- Missing rate scenarios to test control robustness

This approach preserves intellectual property while accurately representing real reconciliation challenges.

## 🧭 Position Within the Portfolio

This section sits within the broader analytics workflow as the **controls and automation layer**:

Data Engineering → Automation & Controls → Modelling → Analytics → Business Insight

It complements:
- Data engineering pipelines (Section 01)
- Semantic modelling and enrichment (Section 03)
- Advanced analytics and ML (Section 05)
- Business-facing dashboards (Section 04)

---

## 📈 Why This Matters

This work demonstrates the ability to:

- Automate finance controls at scale  
- Design reconciliation logic that is explainable and auditable  
- Reduce manual intervention and operational risk  
- Build reusable, general-purpose analytics tools  
- Think in terms of systems, not one-off scripts  

It reflects how analytics supports **financial governance**, not just insight generation.
