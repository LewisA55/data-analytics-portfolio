📘 Notebook 04 — Price/Cost Pattern Mining & Charge Behaviour Analysis

A portfolio case study analysing pricing patterns, charge behaviour, and cost irregularities across shipments.

Objective

This notebook explores how price, cost, margin, and charge-level patterns behave across shipments, using advanced analytical techniques to:

Detect pricing inconsistencies

Understand how different charge types contribute to loss-making shipments

Surface structural patterns in cost allocation

Identify operational inefficiencies and revenue leakage

Reveal charge combinations strongly associated with profit or loss

It forms part of a broader analysis suite covering anomaly detection, forecasting, segmentation, and executive insights.

Key Components
1. Shipment-Level Price & Cost Behaviour

Aggregated summaries of sales, cost, and margin patterns

Identification of distribution shapes (skewness, tails, variance)

Industry-relevant KPIs such as:

Margin%

Cost per package

Sales-to-cost ratio

2. Charge Type Exploration

Frequency analysis of all charge types

Shipment-level charge presence analysis

Heatmaps showing charge co-occurrence

Detection of charge patterns strongly linked to:

Loss-making shipments

Low-margin shipments

High operational friction areas

3. Charge-to-Loss Behaviour Analysis

Calculation of loss uplift per charge type

Comparison of “baseline loss rate” vs “charge-specific loss rate”

Ranking of charges by risk impact

Identification of charges that:

Drive up losses

Signal process issues

Indicate rate-card discrepancies

Influence service profitability

4. Visual Insights

Portfolio-friendly visuals including:

Distribution plots (sales, cost, margin)

Charge frequency bar charts

Charge overlap heatmaps

Loss uplift plots

Shipment-level price/cost scatter patterns

All visuals are annotated and designed to show analytical reasoning, not just charts.

5. Business Interpretation

Each section includes domain-specific commentary such as:

Supplier or service combinations that regularly produce negative margins

Charges associated with under-billing or cost escalation

Outlier price patterns that may represent mispriced jobs

Charge structures differing between clients, services, or destinations

These insights demonstrate practical, commercial impact, ideal for audit/data roles.
