# 📊 Business Performance Insights  
### Power BI Dashboards & Executive Analytics Outputs

This section contains the **business-facing analytics layer** of the portfolio, delivered through Power BI dashboards and presentation-ready outputs.

The reports in this folder translate **engineered, modelled, and analytically enriched datasets** into clear, interactive insights designed for commercial, operational, and finance stakeholders.

This is where technical analysis becomes **decision support**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Section

The objective of this section is to demonstrate how complex analytical outputs can be:

- Communicated clearly to non-technical stakeholders  
- Structured into intuitive performance narratives  
- Explored interactively across multiple business dimensions  
- Designed to support real operational and commercial decisions  

The focus is on **clarity, credibility, and usability**, not visual novelty.

---

## 📈 Analytical Scope

The dashboards in this section surface insights across:

- Supplier performance and cost behaviour  
- Client revenue, volume, and margin profiles  
- Service-level trends and exceptions  
- Loss-making and free-of-charge shipments  
- Comparative performance over time  
- Contribution analysis and concentration risk  

The visuals are intentionally aligned with the upstream analytics work (Notebooks 01–05).
